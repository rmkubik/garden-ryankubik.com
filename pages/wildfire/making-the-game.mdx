## <Icon>üî•</Icon> Making Wildfire Swap

I've been working on Wildfire Swap in my spare time for several years at this point.

It started back in Ludum Dare 38 in 2018 and it's still in progress here in August 2020.

## The Wildfire Swap newsletters

This project accompanied my first attempt at writing and running a newsletter.

For over a year, I sent a weekly email with updates on my life and the development of the game.

It was a pretty rewarding and helpful process.

I think it helped me grow as a writer, communicator, and marketer.

In the end, writing a monthly piece of content felt like eternally running on a treadmill.

I've since stopped writing monthly newsletters, and feel much better about it.

Wildfire Swap was originally a jam entry to Ludum Dare 38 back in mid 2018.

Here's the original prototype:
